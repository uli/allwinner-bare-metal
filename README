This is an experimental branch targeting Orange Pi H3-based boards that adds a lot
of functionality, mostly by including external libraries.

This branch includes support for running applications based on
alwinner-bare-metal in the Jailhouse hypervisor.

It includes server programs (libc_server and sdl_server) that run on the
Linux root cell and provide services to the bare metal application such as
input events and library calls.

It also comes with a gdb stub and a communications program (jailgdb) that
allows to debug the bare metal application from the Linux root cell.

It requires a modified hypervisor (particularly for the GDB stub) and a
suitable cell configuration, as well as a patched kernel for the root cell
that maps memory accessed through /dev/mem coherently. You should be able to
find those nearby. Hopefully.

Original README:

This repository represents an attempt to run bare metal code on an Allwinner SoC.

Current target is the H3. This code will implement drivers for all hardware used
with the exception of DRAM which is initialized by u-boot SPL.

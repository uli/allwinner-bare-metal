This is a modified version of the proof-of-concept H.264 video encoder for
Allwinner SoCs found at https://github.com/uboborov/cedrus . It has been
tested with the hardware driver found at
https://github.com/Rexarrior/sunxi-cedar-mainline .

It is designed to run on the root Linux cell of a Jailhouse environment and
records video and audio from an interface described in video_encoder.h that
is fed by a bare-metal application, then writes the H.264-encoded video and
raw PCM audio data to an AVI file.

The bare-metal application is resposible for converting the input image to
NV12 pixel format, which for screen recording can be achieved in hardware
using the display_capture_*() API of this framework.
